Provide your solution here:

Step 1: Verify the High Memory Usage
- Possible Causes/Scenarios:

	+ Incorrect Monitoring Data: Monitoring tools may be misreporting memory usage due to errors or misconfigurations.

	+ Transient Memory Spike: A temporary increase in memory usage that's no longer present.

- Impacts:

	+ Misleading Information: Acting on inaccurate data could lead to unnecessary troubleshooting efforts.

- Troubleshoot steps:

	+ Manually Check Memory Usage: free -h
	Purpose: Confirms current memory usage, including total, used, and available memory.

	+ Review System Processes: top -b -o +%MEM | head -n 15
	Purpose: Identifies the top processes consuming memory.

- Recovery steps: This step is carried only if there is nothing weird in above "Troubleshoot Steps" 
	+ Validate Monitoring Tools: Ensure that monitoring agents are functioning correctly.
	+ Reconfigure or update monitoring tools if faults are found.

Step 2: Identify Top Memory-Consuming Processes
- Possible Causes/Scenarios:

	+ Zombie or Defunct Processes: Orphaned processes holding onto memory.
	Refer: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/2807

	+ Unexpected Processes Running: Other services are consuming memory.

- Impacts:

	+ Resource Depletion: Non-essential processes reduce the memory available for NGINX.

	+ Performance Issues: NGINX may not perform optimally due to limited resources.

- Troubleshoot steps:

	+ List Processes by Memory Usage: ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 10
	Purpose: Displays the top processes using memory.
	
	+ List Processes and find Z status: ps aux | grep Z
	Purpose: Find if there is any zombie process.

	+ Check Services: sudo systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
	Purpose: Find if there are any unnecessary services running.

- Recovery steps:
	+ Terminate Unnecessary Processes: Identify unwanted processes. 
	  Terminate them using: sudo kill -9 <PID>
	  In case that it keeps spamming and we cannot know about the root cause, a work-around solution 		may be running a crob job to periodically find and kill processes that have Z state.

	+ Disable Unneeded Services at Boot: sudo systemctl disable <service_name>

Step 3: Analyze NGINX Worker Processes
- Possible Causes/Scenarios:

	+ Over-allocation of Workers: worker_processes are set too high compared to selected hardware.

	+ High worker_connections: Excessive connections compared to selected hardware.

- Impacts:

	+ Excessive Memory Consumption: Allocated workers consume more memory than the VM can provide.

	+ Potential for Resource Contention: May lead to performance degradation.

- Troubleshoot steps:

	+ Review NGINX Configuration: Open the config file: sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
	Check: worker_processes and worker_connections.

- Recovery steps:
	+ Adjust Configuration: Set worker_processes to auto: 
	worker_processes auto;
	+ Adjust worker_connections: Set to a reasonable number like 1024.

	+ Reload NGINX: sudo nginx -s reload
Step 4: Check for Memory Leaks in NGINX or Modules
Possible Causes/Scenarios:

Memory Leak in NGINX: Due to bugs or outdated versions.

Faulty Third-Party Modules: Modules not releasing memory properly.

Impacts:

Gradual Memory Increase: Memory usage grows over time until resources are exhausted.

Potential Service Outages: System may become unresponsive or crash.

Recovery Steps:

Monitor Memory Over Time:

Use top, htop, or glances to watch memory usage.

Update NGINX and Modules:

bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
Disable Suspect Modules:

Comment out or remove configurations for non-essential modules.

Restart NGINX:

bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Observe Memory Usage Post-Restart.

Step 5: Examine NGINX Logs for Errors
Possible Causes/Scenarios:

Excessive Logging: Debug or info level logging generating large log files.

Persistent Errors: Repeated errors causing increased resource usage.

Impacts:

Disk Space Consumption: Large logs can fill up disk space.

Increased I/O Load: High disk activity may impact performance.

Recovery Steps:

Check Log File Sizes:

bash
sudo du -h /var/log/nginx/
Adjust Logging Level:

In nginx.conf, set logging to a less verbose level:

nginx
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
Implement Log Rotation:

Ensure logrotate is configured for NGINX logs.

Clear Old Logs:

bash
sudo rm /var/log/nginx/*.log.1
Reload NGINX Configuration:

bash
sudo nginx -s reload
Step 6: Analyze Traffic Patterns for High Load or DDoS
Possible Causes/Scenarios:

Legitimate Traffic Surge: Marketing campaigns or events driving up traffic.

Malicious Traffic: DDoS attacks overwhelming the server.

Impacts:

Resource Exhaustion: High number of connections consume memory.

Service Degradation: Slow or unresponsive service for legitimate users.

Recovery Steps:

Review Access Logs for Anomalies:

bash
sudo tail -n 1000 /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
Identify Malicious IPs:

Look for IPs with excessive requests.

Implement Rate Limiting:

nginx
http {
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=10r/s;
}
server {
    location / {
        limit_req zone=mylimit burst=20;
    }
}
Configure Firewall Rules:

bash
sudo ufw deny from <malicious IP>
Consider DDoS Protection Services:

Use services like Cloudflare or AWS Shield.

Step 7: Check for Other Resource-Intensive Processes
Possible Causes/Scenarios:

Unscheduled Tasks: Backup processes or scans consuming memory.

Unwanted Applications Running: Applications started inadvertently.

Impacts:

Reduced Memory Availability: Less memory for NGINX.

Potential Conflicts: May interfere with network ports or files.

Recovery Steps:

List All Running Processes:

bash
ps -e -o pid,user,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head
Identify Non-NGINX Processes Using Memory:

Examine processes not related to NGINX.

Terminate Unnecessary Processes:

bash
sudo kill <PID>
Disable Automatic Startup of Unnecessary Services:

bash
sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
Step 8: Verify Swap Space Configuration
Possible Causes/Scenarios:

No Swap Space: System starts killing processes when RAM is full.

Excessive Swapping: Indicates insufficient physical memory.

Impacts:

Application Crashes: OOM killer terminates processes.

Performance Issues: Swapping can cause significant slowdowns.

Recovery Steps:

Check Swap Usage:

bash
swapon --show
free -h
Create Swap File If Absent:

bash
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
Make Swap Permanent:

bash
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
Adjust Swappiness Parameter:

bash
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
Step 9: Inspect Disk Space and Inode Usage
Possible Causes/Scenarios:

Low Disk Space: Full disk can cause system instability.

Inode Exhaustion: Too many small files consuming inodes.

Impacts:

Logging Failures: NGINX can't write to logs, possibly affecting operations.

Memory Issues: System may behave unpredictably due to disk space issues.

Recovery Steps:

Check Disk Space Usage:

bash
df -h
Check Inode Usage:

bash
df -i
Identify Large Files:

bash
sudo find / -type f -size +100M
Remove Unnecessary Files:

Clear old logs, caches, and unnecessary files.

Expand Disk Space if Necessary:

Resize the disk or migrate to a larger volume.

Step 10: Restart NGINX Service
Possible Causes/Scenarios:

Memory Fragmentation: Long running processes may have fragmented memory.

Temporary Glitches: Issues resolved by restarting the service.

Impacts:

Brief Downtime: Service interruption during restart.

Potential Resolution: May clear temporary issues affecting memory usage.

Recovery Steps:

Restart NGINX:

bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
Monitor Memory Usage Post-Restart:

bash
watch free -h
Verify Service Functionality:

Confirm that NGINX is operating normally.

Step 11: Plan for Long-Term Solutions
Possible Causes/Scenarios:

Insufficient Resources: The current VM may not meet the demands.

Scalability Needs: Anticipated growth requires infrastructure changes.

Impacts:

Recurring Issues: Without addressing root causes, problems may persist.

Limited Performance: May not handle future load effectively.

Recovery Steps:

Evaluate Resource Usage Trends:

Use monitoring tools to analyze resource consumption over time.

Consider Scaling Options:

Vertical Scaling: Upgrade VM to have more RAM and CPU.

Horizontal Scaling: Deploy additional load balancers and implement clustering.

Implement Robust Monitoring and Alerting:

Set up alerts for high memory usage thresholds.

Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog for continuous monitoring.

Optimize NGINX Configuration:

Fine-tune settings based on performance testing.

Use caching and other performance-enhancing strategies.

Regular Maintenance and Updates:

Keep system packages and NGINX up to date.

Regularly review configurations and logs for early detection of issues.
